        <h2>The ASCII Character Set</h2>
          ASCII uses the values from 0 to 31 (and 127) for control characters.

          ASCII uses the values from 32 to 126 for letters, digits, and symbols.
            
          ASCII does not use the values from 128 to 255.</p>

          <h2>The ANSI Character Set</h2>
          ANSI is identical to ASCII for the values from 0 to 127.

          ANSI has a proprietary set of characters for the values from 128 to 159.

          ANSI is identical to UTF-8 for the values from 160 to 255.

          <h2>The UTF-8 Character Set</h2>
          UTF-8 is identical to ASCII for the values from 0 to 127.

          UTF-8 does not use the values from 128 to 159. 

          UTF-8 is identical to both ANSI and 8859-1 for the values from 160 to 255.

          UTF-8 continues from the value 256 with more than 10 000 different characters.
